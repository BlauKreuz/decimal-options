# Decimal Options for Rulers
  A simple module for adjusting ruler text accuracy in Foundry VTT.
  
  All measurements are still done with 0.01 units accuracy (Foundry default), but the distance texts get rounded for better visibility. Especially useful on gridless scenes and it also works with the ![Drag Ruler](https://github.com/manuelVo/foundryvtt-drag-ruler) module.
  
  This module does not effect Foundry's default measurement templates.
  
    Accuracy options in distance units (meters, feet, etc.):  0.01 / 0.1 / 0-5 / 1

Big thanks to author of Drag Ruler, manuelVO / St√§bchenfisch, for helping out and getting me started with my very first module!
